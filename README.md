Objects and properties
==================

Create three javaScript objects stored in variables

According to MDN, an object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects.

This was my first introduction to writing Objects.
